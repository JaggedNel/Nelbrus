Project development using the NELBRUS OS is designed to reduce labor costs by defining the functionality required for most components and complexes in advance.

The system allows you to develop subprograms that have standard functionality: performing actions with frequency or deferred actions, there is support for Ala console commands. Subroutines can be started or stopped while the program block is running.
